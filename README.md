# shlides

Create slideshows with bash. Every slide is a plain bash script, so you can do whatever you do inside a 
terminal in your presentation.

Running with sample slides:

```
./shlides
```

Running with your own slides:

```
./shlides folder-with-my-presentation-slides
```

This is also something new.
